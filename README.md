# DreadrootMountain
A Caves of Qud mod based on [Starapple Valley](https://github.com/acegiak/QudStarappleValley) (hence the name).
A lot of the code originally comes from there. The majority of the changes boil down to stripping out anything unrelated to the core functionality.

Starapple Valley is very complex, and because of that, it's kind of buggy.
This is a stripped-down version of that mod, allowing for the same sort of farming without as much fuss.

Do note that this is NOT compatible with Starapple Valley.

## How to play
When installed, this mod will cause most plants in-game to drop seeds, which can be planted. These will grow after some time passes. They do not require watering like in Starapple Valley.

Some plants have a domestic version which will ripen periodically (a feature bizarrely absent from the vanilla game). Vanilla plants have been left untouched for the most part so as to not ruin the aesthetics of some areas which use unripe plants as a prominent decorative feature (Ezra, Joppa, etc.). That said, all vanilla plants lacking a domestic variant will still be plantable and grow more-or-less as expected.

Domestic plants currently are limited to the following:
<ul>
<li>Dreadroot</li>
<li>Lahbloom</li>
<li>Witchwood</li>
</ul>
