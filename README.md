# DreadrootMountain
A Caves of Qud mod based loosely on Starapple Valley (hence the name).
Starapple Valley is very complex, and because of that, it's kind of buggy.
This is a stripped-down version of that mod, allowing for the same sort of farming without as much fuss.
Do note that this is NOT compatible with Starapple Valley.
